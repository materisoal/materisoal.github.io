                        Elephant and Friends
<p>One day an elephant wandered into a 
forest in search of friends. He saw a monkey on a tree. “Will you be my 
friend?” asked the elephant. Replied the monkey, “You are too big. You 
can not swing from trees like me.” Next, the elephant met a rabbit. He 
asked him to be his friends. But the rabbit said, “You are too big to 
play in my burrow!” Then the elephant met a frog.</p>
<p>“Will you be my friend? He asked.</p>
<p>“How can I?” asked the frog.</p>
<p>“You are too big to leap about like me.”</p>
<p>The elephant was upset. He met a fox next.</p>
<p>“Will you be my friend?” he asked the fox.</p>
<p>The fox said, “Sorry, sir, you are too big.”</p>
<p>The next day, the elephant saw all the animals in the forest running 
for their lives. The elephant asked them what the matter was. The bear 
replied, “There is a tiger in the forest. He’s trying to gobble us all 
up!” The animals all ran away to hide. The elephant wondered what he 
could do to solve everyone in the forest. Meanwhile, the tiger kept 
eating up whoever he could find. The elephant walked up to the tiger and
 said, “Please, Mr. Tiger, do not eat up these poor animals.”</p>
<p>“Mind your own business!” growled the tiger.</p>
<p>The elephant has a no choice but to give the tiger a hefty kick. The 
frightened tiger ran for his life. The elephant ambled back into the

She lived with her Aunt and Uncle because her parents were dead.<br />Complication 1<br /> <br />One day she heard her Uncle and Aunt talking about leaving Snow White in the castle because they both wanted to go to America and they didn’t have enough money to take Snow White.<br /> <br />Snow White did not want her Uncle and Aunt to do this so she decided it would be best if she ran away. The next morning she ran away from home when her Aunt and Uncle were having breakfast. She ran away into the woods.<br />Resolution 1<br /> <br />Then she saw this little cottage. She knocked but no one answered so she went inside and fell asleep.<br />  <br /><br />Meanwhile, the seven dwarfs were coming home from work. They went inside. There they found Snow White sleeping. Then Snow White woke up. She saw the dwarfs. The dwarfs said, “what is your name?” Snow White said, “My name is Snow White.”<br /> Doc, one of the dwarfs, said, “If you wish, you may live here with us.” Snow White said, “Oh could I? Thank you.” Then Snow White told the dwarfs the whole story and finally Snow White and the 7 dwarfs lived happily ever after.<br /><br />2. Three Fishes<br /><br />Orientation <br />Once, three fishes lived in a pond. One evening, some fishermen passed by the pond and saw the fishes. 'This pond is full of fish', they told each other excitedly. 'We have never fished here before. We must come back tomorrow morning with our nets and catch these fish!' Then the fishermen left.<br /> Complication <br />When the eldest of the three fishes heard this, he was troubled. He called the other fishes together and said, 'Did you hear what the fishermen said? We must leave this pond at once. The fishermen will return tomorrow and kill us all!' The second of the three fishes agreed. 'You are right', he said. 'We must leave the pond.'<br />But the youngest fish laughed. 'You are worrying without reason', he said. 'We have lived in this pond all our lives, and no fisherman has ever come here. Why should these men return? I am not going anywhere - my luck will keep me safe.'<br />Reslution <br />The eldest of the fishes left the pond that very evening with his entire family. The second fish saw the fishermen coming in the distance early next morning and left the pond at once with all his family. The third fish refused to leave even then.<br />The fishermen arrived and caught all the fish left in the pond. The third fish's luck did not help him - he too was caught and killed.<br /> The fish who saw trouble ahead and acted before it arrived as well as the fish who acted as soon as it came both survived. But the fish who relied only on luck and did nothing at all died. So also in life.<br /><br /><br /><strong>An elephant and crocodiles</strong><br />

Last week I took my five-year old son, Willy, to a musical
instrument store in my hometown. I wanted to buy him a set of junior drum
because his drum teacher advised me to buy him one. Willy likes listening to
music very much. He also likes asking me everything he wants to know. Even his
questions sometimes seem precocious for a boy of his age. He is very
inquisitive.

<br />

We went there by car. On the way, we saw a policeman
standing near a traffic light regulating the passing cars and other vehicles.
He blew his whistle now and then.

<br />

Seeing the policeman blowing his whistle, Willy asked me at
once, "Dad, why is the policeman using a whistle, not a drum?"

<br />

Hearing his unexpected question I answered reluctantly,
"Because he is not Phil Collins!"

to go to a ball (pesta dansa)  in the palace. He wanted to find the Crown
Prince a wife.

The step sisters went to the ball that night with
their mother. Cindrella was left alone. She cried because she actually wanted
to go to the ball, too.

Just then a fairy godmother came. With her magic wand,
she gave Cindrella a coach (kereta),
two horses and footmen. She also gave Cindrella a lovely dress to wear the ball
and a pair of glass slippers. She told Cindrella to come home before midnight.

At the ball, Cindrella danced all night with the
Prince. The Prince fell in love with her. At midnight, Cindrella ran home.
Unfortunately, one of her slippers slipped off at the door. She did not have
time to put it back on. The Prince was sad as he could not find Cindrella again
that night.

The next day, the Prince and his men brought along the
glass slipper. They went all over the Kingdom to search for the owner.

After searching for along time, finally, they came to
Cindrella’s house. The slipper fit her. The prince was very happy to find
Cindrella again. They got married and lived ever after.

                        Social Media are Bad for Teenagers

Social media Web sites, such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and many others have become nearly inescapable facets of modern life, particularly for teenagers. Social media is becoming more than just a part of their world, it’s becoming their world. Teens are spending more and more time online, usually on a social media platform like Facebook or Twitter. Most teens now have smart phones where they are on social media networks all throughout the day. They are constantly texting, tweeting, and posting pictures via Snapchat and Instagram. However, hyper-connected to social media could be bad for them.

Today teens don’t know how to disconnect. Social media has allowed them to take their life online from the time they wake up till they back to sleep via their smart phone. One reason this “always connected” activity is harmful is because of the alarming trend of cyberbullying. Bullying has now moved from not only being in the school and on the bus, but online. What does this mean? If a teen is getting bullied, they cannot get away from it! The people bullying them simply continue their bullying via social media

A new study has found that teenagers who engage with social media during the night could be damaging their sleep and increasing their risk of anxiety and depression. Teenagers spoke about the pressure they felt to make themselves available 24/7, and the resulting anxiety if they did not respond immediately to texts or posts. Teens are so emotionally invested in social media that a fifth of secondary school pupils will wake up at night and log on, just to make sure they don’t miss out.

Another impact social media has had on teens is teens being more comfortable online doing things that they should be more sensitive to doing. A separate study by the National Citizen Service found that, rather than talking to their parents, girls seek comfort on social media when they are worried. The survey also suggests that girls are likely to experience stress more often than boys – an average of twice a week.

Social media such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and many others are basically created to connect everyone around the globe so they can interact and communicate each other. However, too much exposure of social media can also be bad especially for teenagers. As it mentioned above, social media could become media for bullying, risk them of anxiety and depression, and risk their real-life social interaction. Therefore, social media are dangerous for teenagers’ health both mentally and emotionally.<br />

                        Aladdin and the Magic LampOnce upon a time, there lived a handsome boy in Baghdad. The name was Aladdin. He was a clever boy, but he did not like to work.<br /><br />One day Aladdin’s mother sent him to the market place to look for a job. In the market he met a magician. The magician asked him to work together with him. If Aladdin could do, he would get a lot of gold coins and jewellery. The magician asked Aladdin to go inside the cave and find a magical lamp there. He also gave a ring and said, “If you are in any trouble, rub this ring and a genie will come to your rescue!”<br /><br />Aladdin went into the cave. Inside the cave, Aladdin was surprised by what he saw. Every corner was full of gold and treasures. A few minutes later, he found the lamp and quickly returned to the entrance of the cave. Aladdin called out, “Magician, I have found the lamp.” “Excellent,” answered the magician. “Quick, pass it to me!”<br /><br />Aladdin did not trust the magician so he said, “Not so fast Magician. You must help me out of this cave first.”<br /><br />The magician became very angry. When Aladdin was walking to the entrance, the magician pushed a huge rock over the entrance of the cave and left Aladdin and the lamp behind. Aladdin tried to move the rock all by himself, but it was too big and heavy, “Oh no! I am trapped in the cave!” he cried.<br /><br />Suddenly, he remembered the magic ring. He rubbed it with the palm of his hand. To his surprise, a genie appeared before him and in a powerful voice said, “Master, I am the Genie of the ring. How can I help you?”<br /><br />Aladdin was frightened, but he soon found the courage to ask, “Could you please send me back to my house?” In no time at all Aladdin was back home.<br /><br />Aladdin took out the lamp. He wondered what would happen if he rubbed it. As Aladdin was rubbing it, all of a sudden another enormous genie stood before him. The genie of the lamp said, “Master, your wish is my command.” Aladdin was very excited and wished for an enormous palace and bags full of gold.<br /><br />One day, a beautiful princess was passing by Aladdin’s palace. She stopped to talk to Aladdin and soon they became good friends. Before long, Aladdin and Jasmine fell in love each other. She married Aladdin and lived happily.<br /><br />Questions :<br />1. What is the type of the text?<br />2. What is the text about?<br />3. What is the purpose of the text?<br />4. What kind of generic structure will you find in the text?<br />5. What is the main idea of second paragraph?<br />6. What's in the magic lamp Aladdin asked?<br />7. What is given by the magician to Aladdin?<br />8. "He wondered what would happen if he rubbed it." (8th paragraph). What does the underlined word refer to?<br />9. "The name was Aladdin.
